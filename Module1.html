                At its core, a network is a collection of interconnected devices that can share resources and information. These devices
                can be computers, servers, printers, mobile phones, and more. The purpose of a network is to facilitate communication and data exchange.

                    Your home Wi-Fi setup is a simple network. Your laptop, smartphone, and smart TV are all connected to your router,

                A computer network specifically refers to two or more computers connected together to share resources, such as files,
                printers, or internet access. It enables electronic communication among devices and users.

                The "network edge" refers to the parts of a computer network that connect to end devices, such as your laptop,
                smartphone, or smart home devices. It's where applications and services are consumed by users.
                This contrasts with the "network core," which consists of high-speed routers and links that transfer data over long distances.

                Network topology describes the physical or logical arrangement of connected devices in a network.
                Common topologies include Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh, and Tree. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of cost,
                reliability, and ease of management.

                    In a <strong>Star Topology</strong>, all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. If the central device fails,
